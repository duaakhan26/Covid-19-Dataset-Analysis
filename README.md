# Covid-19-Dataset-Analysis
Analyzing a COVID-19 dataset to derive insights into the pandemic's spread, impact on healthcare systems, and trends in infection rates.

# Project Overview

## Aimed Problem

Addressing challenges in combating COVID-19, including new variants, vaccine hesitancy, incomplete global vaccination coverage, and inconsistent preventive measures.

## Objective

The "INFECTECH" project aims to analyze large-scale COVID-19 datasets, utilizing scientific models and statistical analysis to identify trends, patterns, and risk factors. The goal is to provide policymakers with essential information for formulating targeted strategies and interventions.

# Approach

## Data and Attributes

- **Source:** The COVID-19 dataset is obtained from OWID, featuring 53 attributes covering total cases, new cases, total deaths, vaccination data, demographic factors, and health indicators.

## Concepts Utilized

Leveraging statistical and data science concepts for:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Ensuring a reliable dataset through removal of irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicates.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizing Matplotlib and Plotly for insightful visualizations.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - **K-Means Clustering:** Identifying patterns among countries based on population and COVID-19 cases.
  - **Linear Regression:** Analyzing the relationship between population size and COVID-19 statistics.

# Code Methodology

## Data Preprocessing

- Eliminating irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and removing duplicates to ensure a streamlined and reliable dataset.

## Machine Learning Concepts

### K-Means Clustering Model

- **Training and Testing:** Utilizing the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and exploring patterns among countries.

### Linear Regression Model

- **Training and Testing:** Developing models to predict total cases and total deaths based on population size.

# Visualizations

Utilizing Matplotlib and Plotly for informative visualizations, including pie charts and a graphical user interface (GUI) dashboard.

## GUI Dashboard

- **Pages:** Interactive GUI dashboard with three pages: Main, Visualizations, and Predictions.
- **Features:** Enhancing data exploration and providing predictions on total deaths and total cases based on user-input population values.

# Conclusion

The "INFECTECH" project adopts a comprehensive approach, integrating statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze COVID-19 datasets. Through insightful visualizations and an interactive GUI, the project aims to contribute to informed decision-making and public health strategies.
